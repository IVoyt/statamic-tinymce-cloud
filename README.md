> A TinyMCE Cloud fieldtype for Statamic.

This is a TinyMCE Cloud Fieldtype for Statamic 3 utilising the cloud-hosted version of TinyMCE.

This requires a free API key from [tiny.cloud](https://www.tiny.cloud), and simplifies your build steps as the cloud
version will always run the latest version from Tiny, and doesn't need to be included in your app's bundle.

In the configuration you are able to choose which TinyMCE version you want to use - you now have the choice of 
TinyMCE 6 or TinyMCE 5.
